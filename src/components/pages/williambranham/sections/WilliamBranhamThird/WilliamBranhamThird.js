                <h1>William Branham and Jesus Christ: A Parallel of the Messianic Sign</h1>
                <p>
                    Moses, the great prophet of the Old Testament, made a profound prophecy in <strong>Deuteronomy 18:15</strong>, saying, <i>“The Lord your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from among your brethren.”</i> This prophecy had a dual fulfillment—it pointed to both <strong>Jesus Christ</strong> and <strong>William Branham</strong>, two men whose lives and ministries bore striking similarities to that of Moses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moses led <strong>the first exodus</strong>—delivering Israel from physical bondage in Egypt. <strong>Jesus Christ led the second exodus</strong>, taking people from the bondage of the Law into the grace of salvation. And in the <strong>last days, William Branham’s ministry ushered in the third exodus</strong>, calling believers out of denominational confusion into the true liberty of the Holy Ghost.
                </p>
                <h3>The Messianic Sign: Revealing the Secrets of the Heart</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the greatest proofs of Jesus’ divine commission was the <strong>Messianic sign</strong>—the supernatural ability to discern the <strong>secrets of the heart</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During His ministry, Jesus demonstrated this sign to two groups of people:
                </p>
                <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <strong>The Jews</strong> (John 1:47-49 – Jesus told Nathanael, <i>“Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”</i>)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>The rod turning into a serpent</strong> – A demonstration of God's authority over the enemy (Exodus 4:3-4).
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                </p>
                <h3>Three Signs: The Vindication of a Prophet</h3>
                <p>
                Both Moses and William Branham were given three distinct signs to validate their ministry.
                </p>
                <h4>Moses’ Three Signs:</h4>
                <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <strong>A sign in his hand</strong> – When Moses placed his hand inside his cloak, it became leprous and was then restored (Exodus 4:6-7).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>The rod turning into a serpent</strong> – A demonstration of God's authority over the enemy (Exodus 4:3-4).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Turning water into blood</strong> – A sign of judgment upon Egypt (Exodus 4:9).
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Two of these three signs were impersonated by Jannes and Jambres, the magicians of Pharaoh’s court (Exodus 7:11-12), but God’s power ultimately prevailed.
                </p>
                <h4>William Branham’s Three Pulls:</h4>
                <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <strong>A sign in the hand</strong> – He could detect sicknesses and diseases through vibrations in his hand.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Discernment of the hearts</strong> – He could supernaturally reveal the thoughts, names, and circumstances of individuals, just as Jesus did (John 1:47-48).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>The Third Pull</strong> – A sacred and final phase, divided into three parts:
                            </li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Speaking things into existence</strong> (as Moses commanded plagues and miracles).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Preaching to the eternally lost</strong> (as Jesus did before the Resurrection in 1 Peter).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Opening the Word</strong> (revealing mysteries hidden since the foundation of the world).
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just like in Moses’ time, <strong>William Branham’s first two signs were impersonated</strong>, but the <strong>Third Pull was not meant to be a public demonstration</strong>—it was reserved for the elect, a secret work of God.
                </p>
                <h3>The Pillar of Fire and the Cloud</h3>
                <p>
                    Both Moses and William Branham had ministries marked by supernatural manifestations of God's presence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The presence of the <strong>Pillar of Fire and the Cloud</strong> was central to Moses’ ministry. It led the Israelites by night and stood between them and their enemies. It was a divine witness that God was with His servant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Amazingly, <strong>William Branham’s ministry was also characterized by the same supernatural presence</strong>. The <strong>Pillar of Fire</strong> appeared with him multiple times, and a famous photograph taken in <strong>1950 in Houston, Texas</strong> , showed the divine Light hovering above his head. The Cloud that appeared in <strong>1963 in Arizona</strong>, just before he preached the opening of the Seven Seals, remains a mystery to science.
                </p>
                <h3>A Messenger of Deliverance</h3>
                <p>
                    Just as <strong>Moses was sent to deliver Israel from Egypt</strong>, William Branham was sent to <strong>call God’s people out of religious systems and bring them into true spiritual freedom</strong>. His ministry <strong>restored the faith once delivered to the saints</strong>, emphasizing:
                </p>
                <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The return to biblical truth, free from denominational creeds.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The supernatural leading of the Holy Spirit.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The revelation of God’s Word in its fullness.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>A Divine Pattern</h3>
                <p>
                    The parallels between Moses and William Branham show a consistent pattern in how God sends deliverers in different ages. Both:
                </p>
                <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Led an exodus (Moses: physical, Branham: spiritual).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Had three supernatural signs (two of which were impersonated).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Were accompanied by the Pillar of Fire and Cloud as divine confirmation.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just as Moses led Israel to the Promised Land, William Branham’s ministry called believers back to the original faith, leading them into true spiritual freedom. His life and mission were part of God’s divine plan to restore His people before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.
